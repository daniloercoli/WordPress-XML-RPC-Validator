# WordPress XML-RPC validator #

WordPress plugin that checks the validity of the XML-RPC Endpoint of WordPress sites.

If you're having throubles login into your site by using one of the WordPress mobile apps, this plugin can help you to find the real cause of the issue. 

**Advanced usage**

It's possible to launch the validator by passing parameters to it.

Available parameter are _site_url_ and _user_agent_.
EX: http://xmlrpc.eritreo.it?user_agent=my-user-agent-here&site_url=daniloercoli.com

**Note**

Plugins and incompatible themes can also cause issues when using your site on a mobile app.

If deactivating all the plugins doesn’t help then suggest they try a default theme. Also check what user role they’re signing in with.
Sometimes signing in as an unusual user (something other than administrator) can cause strange things with the app.
